**Considering the Basics**

I'm focusing on the visual elements. I've got the background in mind; a light gray/white gradient or solid white seems right. Now, I need to visualize the main image: a smiling woman in a lab coat with medicine. Finally, I'm thinking about rendering the headline in Japanese.


**Adding the Supporting Elements**

Now, I'm integrating the specific content components. The sub-headline is set: "Skin is made from the inside. Therefore, skin beauty treatment delivered from the inside." Following that will be the three badges, emphasizing user count, pharmaceutical prescriptions, and efficacy. I've designed a prominent CTA button that reads "Book a free consultation." I'm also including a CTA subtext, along with a disclaimer.
