**Considering the Basics**

I'm currently focused on the foundational elements for recreating this web page. Right now, I'm thinking about the background. I believe a light gray/white gradient or solid white will suit best. Next, I will figure out how to incorporate a main image with a smiling woman in a lab coat, holding medicine bottles and blister packs, alongside a headline in large, bold Japanese text.


**Adding the Textual Elements**

I've moved on to the core content. I am now conceptualizing the sub-headline, and I'll include three badges displaying statistics. I'll need to figure out a strong call to action button, too. A green-to-teal gradient seems suitable, with supporting information about the consultations. The footer will contain a disclaimer with the data. I'm using Tailwind CSS and Google fonts.


**Refining the Layout**

I'm now zeroing in on the finer details of the layout, and I'm really starting to feel like I have a good handle on how this will look. I've chosen Noto Sans JP for the Japanese text, and I'll use Font Awesome if any icons become necessary. I'll utilize placeholder images to define the structure of the left-side text content and right-side image. I am currently considering the headline style: `text-5xl font-bold`, with a pink color for "99%." I'm looking at using tags like `border border-blue-300 text-blue-400 rounded-full px-4 py-1`, and my button will have a gradient background and will be styled as `bg-gradient-to-r from-green-300 to-teal-500 text-white rounded-full py-4 px-12 text-xl font-bold shadow-lg`. I've written the main Japanese text: "化粧品・レーザーでは", "届かない99%へ。", "肌は内側から作られる。", and "だから、内側から届ける美肌治療。"
