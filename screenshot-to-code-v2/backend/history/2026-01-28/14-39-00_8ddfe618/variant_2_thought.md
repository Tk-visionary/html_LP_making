**Considering the Basics**

I'm currently focused on the foundational elements for recreating this web page. Right now, I'm thinking about the background. I believe a light gray/white gradient or solid white will suit best. Next, I will figure out how to incorporate a main image with a smiling woman in a lab coat, holding medicine bottles and blister packs, alongside a headline in large, bold Japanese text.


**Refining the Details**

I've moved on to fleshing out the sub-headline, badges, and the crucial call to action. I am thinking of a large, inviting, green gradient button for the CTA, with precise Japanese text. I am also working on rounded badges to emphasize user count, medical prescription availability, and efficacy. I am also considering the footer now. I will use Tailwind CSS and Google Fonts.
